Create a virtual environment
Run this command in the terminal:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
python3 ensures you use Python 3.

-m venv tells Python to create a virtual environment.

venv is the name of the folder where the environment will be created (you can name it anything, but venv or .venv is common).




# To activate a virtual environment in Python, use the following command:

# On Linux or macOS:
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
\path\to\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows (PowerShell):
\path\to\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1




#for this project
cd /PODEZ
source venv/bin/activate 
#as i am in ubuntu and cd to root PODEZ :)

 Step-by-Step Task 1: Create the Layout
Try writing this part of the code yourself with these instructions:

In app.py:
Set a page title and centered layout

Add a main title using st.title()

Add a short description using st.markdown()

Use st.file_uploader() to let the user upload a .jpg, .png, or .jpeg image

If an image is uploaded, display it using st.image()

Add two columns using st.columns(2) for the “Extract” and “Compile” buttons

Use st.button() for each action (functionality can be fake for now)

What is Tesseract?
Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine that reads text from images. Perfect for our “handwritten code” idea.


need to install the google-generativeai library. You can do this using pip:
